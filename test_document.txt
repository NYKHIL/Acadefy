This is a test document for Acadefy file upload functionality.

It contains some sample content about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning  
3. Reinforcement learning
4. Neural networks
5. Deep learning

This document can be used to test the file upload and text extraction features of the Acadefy platform.
